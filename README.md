# Rage & ParaSyght

Hey, I'm Aether and the above are Rage & ParaSyght.

Before any accusations neither of these programs are originally mine, I simply took both tools and modified them.

Rage was simply turned into a exe file. It was originally developed by [††#7777](https://github.com/TT-Tutorials/Rage-Multi-Tool). I will provide instructions to setup both exe and the python version.

ParaySght is originally known as XTool developed by [NotTiie](https://github.com/NotTiie/XTool), I took the tool and changed the GUI to be slightly easier to use, this too comes in both exe and python versions, both of which will be provided instructions for.


*Note : If using exe versions for either Rage or ParaSyght, many features wont work so I highly suggest that you use python versions*

Finally, I am not to be held responsible for the terminating of your account from using these tools.

## Installation


* Go to `download` in this repo and it'll give you the mediafire link, download from there untill I update this.



* Make sure you have [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
